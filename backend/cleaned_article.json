      "text": "Your paper reconstructs Nguyen’s argument on layered agency and then observes the impact of “AI” systems on this agency as a mediator. You also look at submersion and flow state and discuss how this AI mediator impacts upon that. You also give some reflections on the morality of how the AI affects the relationship between our outer and inner agents vis a vis game play. The main thrust of your argument seems to be that the impact of these AI mediators can be both positive and negative, the negative possibly hard to identify due to its gamified state.",

      "text": "Your paper has a good reconstruction of Nguyen’s argument about agential layers, keeping the key points and leading effectively into your own discussion of games and algorithms. Your points on choice are interesting ones especially when placed in the frame of social media that gamifies interactions in the real world by placing a layer of unreality over them in their systems. I find this kind of argument compelling as we have seen social media used to galvanize political messaging in recent years.",

      "text": "Where the paper mentions pseudo-agency based around not even realizing you are the one designing the agency, I think this could have a little more depth. Many games have this kind of “hidden agency” e.g. board games that have legacy elements which encourage further play, tabletop roleplaying games(ttrpgs) where you level up and unlock new abilities, sports where you are encouraged to buy higher performance kit to improve your game. None of these examples have algorithms driving them but they are either monetizing (in the kit example) or giving that dopamine hit (ttrpgs and board games that encourage further play). I think deeper investigation into your claims of algorithmic influence could strengthen this argument, while examining the counter argument. This is an interesting argument and one I would like to see you develop further.",

I think it is important to define what exactly you mean when you use the term AI in your paper, although it is used frequently nowadays it seems to cover a wide range of definitions, narrowing this down could help bring clarity to the reader.",
