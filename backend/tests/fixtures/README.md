Manual QA fixtures for strict cleaner

Files expected here:

- bullets.txt: bullet lines, hyphenation across line breaks, and blank lines between sections.
- paragraphs.txt: two to three paragraphs with awkward wraps.
- short.pdf: a 1–2 page simple text PDF for extractor checks.

Note: short.pdf is not included in the repo. Use any small PDF or export one from a text file for manual testing.
